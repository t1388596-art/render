## User Model Fix for Production - Summary

### Problem
The application was throwing an `AttributeError` in production:
```
AttributeError: Manager isn't available; 'auth.User' has been swapped for 'accounts.CustomUser'
```

This error occurred in `/accounts/signup/` when trying to check for existing users.

### Root Cause
The `custom_signup_view` function in `accounts/views.py` was incorrectly importing Django's default User model:
```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User  # ❌ Wrong - uses default User
```

However, the project uses a custom user model (`accounts.CustomUser`) as defined in `settings.py`:
```python
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'accounts.CustomUser'
```

### Solution
Fixed the import in `accounts/views.py` line 261 to use Django's recommended approach:

**Before:**
```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
```

**After:**
```python
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
User = get_user_model()
```

### Why This Fix Works
- `get_user_model()` dynamically returns the correct user model based on `AUTH_USER_MODEL` setting
- This is the Django-recommended way to reference the user model in custom code
- Works in both development and production environments
- Automatically adapts if the user model changes

### Files Modified
1. `accounts/views.py` - Fixed the User model import in `custom_signup_view` function

### Testing
✅ Created and ran `test_user_model_fix.py` - All tests passed
✅ Django system check passes with no issues
✅ Development server runs without User model errors
✅ Signup functionality works without the original AttributeError

### Production Deployment
This fix is ready for production deployment. The change is:
- Safe (uses Django's recommended pattern)
- Minimal (single line change)
- Backwards compatible
- No database migrations required
- No additional dependencies needed

### Verification Steps for Production
1. Deploy the fixed code
2. Test the signup endpoint: `POST /accounts/signup/`
3. Verify no `AttributeError` related to User model occurs
4. Monitor logs for successful user registrations

- `chat/models.py` - Already uses `get_user_model()` ✅
- `accounts/forms.py` - Already uses `CustomUser` model ✅  
- `accounts/models.py` - CustomUser model properly defined ✅
- `genai_project/settings.py` - AUTH_USER_MODEL properly set ✅
