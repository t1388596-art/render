# 🚀 Quick Deploy to Render.com

This Django GenAI application is now ready for deployment on Render.com!

## ✅ What's Already Configured

- **Production Settings**: Security headers, HTTPS redirects, proper middleware
- **Static Files**: WhiteNoise for serving CSS/JS files
- **Database**: PostgreSQL support with fallback to SQLite
- **Build Process**: Automated build script for Render.com
- **Environment Variables**: Proper configuration for secrets
- **Security**: Production-ready security settings

## 🎯 Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Create Render Web Service
1. Go to [Render.com Dashboard](https://render.com)
2. Click "New +" → "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Use these settings:
   - **Build Command**: `./build.sh`
   - **Start Command**: `./start.sh`

### 3. Set Environment Variables
Add these in Render dashboard:

**Required:**
- `SECRET_KEY`: Generate new key → `python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"`
- `DEBUG`: `False`
- `EURON_API_KEY`: Your Euron API key

**Optional:**
- `DJANGO_LOG_LEVEL`: `INFO`

### 4. Add PostgreSQL Database
1. Create new PostgreSQL database in Render **FIRST**
2. Wait for database to be fully provisioned (this can take a few minutes)
3. Copy the "External Database URL" (Internal URL also works)
4. Add as `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to your web service

**⚠️ Important:** Create the database BEFORE deploying the web service, or the first deployment may fail due to database unavailability.

### 5. Deploy! 🎉
Your app will be available at: `https://your-service-name.onrender.com`

## 🔧 Verification Commands

Before deploying, run these locally:

```bash
# Check deployment readiness
python manage.py check_deployment

# Verify Django deployment settings
python manage.py check --deploy

# Test static files collection
python manage.py collectstatic --no-input

# Test database migrations
python manage.py migrate
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Build fails with database connection error?**
- This is normal! Database may not be accessible during build
- The build script now handles this gracefully
- Migrations will run during startup instead

**Build fails?**
- Check `build.sh` and `start.sh` have execute permissions
- Verify all dependencies in `requirements.txt`
- Check that both database and web service are created

**App won't start?**
- Check environment variables are set
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is configured
- Ensure database is running and accessible
- Check Render logs for detailed error messages

**Database connection issues?**
- Wait a few minutes for database to fully initialize
- Verify the DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Check that database and web service are in same region

**Static files missing?**
- Ensure `collectstatic` runs in build process
- Check WhiteNoise configuration in settings
