# üöÄ Quick Deploy to Render.com

This Django GenAI application is now ready for deployment on Render.com!

## ‚úÖ What's Already Configured

- **Production Settings**: Security headers, HTTPS redirects, proper middleware
- **Static Files**: WhiteNoise for serving CSS/JS files
- **Database**: PostgreSQL support with fallback to SQLite
- **Build Process**: Automated build script for Render.com
- **Environment Variables**: Proper configuration for secrets
- **Security**: Production-ready security settings

## üéØ Quick Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Create Render Web Service
1. Go to [Render.com Dashboard](https://render.com)
2. Click "New +" ‚Üí "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Use these settings:
   - **Build Command**: `./build.sh`
   - **Start Command**: `./start.sh`

### 3. Set Environment Variables
Add these in Render dashboard:

**Required:**
- `SECRET_KEY`: Generate new key ‚Üí `python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"`
- `DEBUG`: `False`
- `EURON_API_KEY`: Your Euron API key

**Optional:**
- `DJANGO_LOG_LEVEL`: `INFO`

### 4. Add PostgreSQL Database
1. Create new PostgreSQL database in Render **FIRST**
2. Wait for database to be fully provisioned (this can take a few minutes)
3. Copy the "External Database URL" (Internal URL also works)
4. Add as `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to your web service

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Create the database BEFORE deploying the web service, or the first deployment may fail due to database unavailability.

### 5. Deploy! üéâ
Your app will be available at: `https://your-service-name.onrender.com`

## üîß Verification Commands

Before deploying, run these locally:

```bash
# Check deployment readiness
python manage.py check_deployment

# Verify Django deployment settings
python manage.py check --deploy

# Test static files collection
python manage.py collectstatic --no-input

# Test database migrations
python manage.py migrate
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Build fails with database connection error?**
- This is normal! Database may not be accessible during build
- The build script now handles this gracefully
- Migrations will run during startup instead

**Build fails?**
- Check `build.sh` and `start.sh` have execute permissions
- Verify all dependencies in `requirements.txt`
- Check that both database and web service are created

**App won't start?**
- Check environment variables are set
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is configured
- Ensure database is running and accessible
- Check Render logs for detailed error messages

**Database connection issues?**
- **Most Common Fix**: Use the **Internal Database URL** (not External)
- Wait a few minutes for database to fully initialize
- Verify the DATABASE_URL environment variable is set correctly
- Check that database and web service are in same region
- Try restarting the web service after database is fully ready

**"could not translate host name" Error (CRITICAL FIX):**

This error means your web service can't reach the PostgreSQL database. Here's the exact fix:

1. **Go to your PostgreSQL database in Render dashboard**
2. **Click on your database service**
3. **In the "Connections" section, find "Internal Database URL"** (NOT External!)
4. **Copy the Internal Database URL** - it should look like:
   ```
   postgresql://user:password@dpg-xxxx-a:5432/database_name
   ```
5. **Go to your web service settings**
6. **Find the "Environment" tab**
7. **Edit the `DATABASE_URL` variable**
8. **Replace it with the Internal Database URL**
9. **Save and restart your web service**

**Why this happens:**
- External Database URL uses public hostnames that aren't accessible from within Render's network
- Internal Database URL uses private network hostnames that work between services
- The hostname `dpg-d3eluumr433s73eqad20-a` suggests you're using External URL

**Alternative Quick Fix:**
If the above doesn't work, your app will automatically fall back to SQLite (as shown in logs), which will work but won't persist data between deployments.

**Emergency URLs for Testing:**
- `/health/` - Basic health check (no database required)
- `/simple/` - Simple home page (no database required)  
- `/db-status/` - Database connection status

**Template missing errors (TemplateDoesNotExist)?**
- Check that all template files are properly committed to git
- Verify template directory structure: `templates/registration/login.html`
- Ensure templates are collected during build process
- Template files must be in the repository, not just locally

**Static files missing?**
- Ensure `collectstatic` runs in build process
- Check WhiteNoise configuration in settings
